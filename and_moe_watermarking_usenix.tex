%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures represent a paradigm shift toward sparse, conditional computation. However, existing watermarking techniques fail to leverage the unique characteristics of MoE models, treating them as generic dense networks and missing opportunities for more robust semantic watermarking. We introduce AND-MoE, the first \textit{Architecture-Native Distortion-Free} watermarking framework specifically designed for MoE models. Our approach fundamentally shifts from embedding watermarks in generated text to utilizing the discrete, combinatorial nature of expert routing decisions as watermark carriers. The framework integrates three complementary techniques: (1) \textit{Proxy Function Internalization} that embeds PMARK's distortion-free theory into token-level generation, (2) \textit{Dynamic Routing Candidate Sets} for efficient pre-computation of routing decisions, and (3) \textit{Multi-Channel Constraint Stacking} that creates high-dimensional watermark trajectories across MoE layers. Theoretical analysis provides provable distortion-free guarantees and robustness bounds against paraphrase attacks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, with significant improvements in robustness while maintaining generation quality. Our work establishes a new foundation for architecture-aware watermarking that can be extended to other sparse neural architectures.

\section{Introduction}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought unprecedented capabilities in text generation, but also raised critical concerns about content authenticity, copyright protection, and misuse prevention~\cite{christ2023watermarking}. Watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the detection of AI-generated content through imperceptible signals embedded during the generation process~\cite{kirchenbauer2023watermark}.

However, the landscape of LLM architectures is rapidly evolving. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, such as Mixtral~\cite{jiang2024mixtral}, represent a paradigm shift toward sparse, conditional computation that fundamentally differs from traditional dense architectures~\cite{fedus2021switch}. These models activate only a subset of experts for each input, creating rich internal routing patterns that remain unexploited by current watermarking approaches.

\textbf{The Fundamental Challenge:} Existing watermarking methods suffer from an inherent "impossible triangle" dilemma, where \textit{robustness}, \textit{imperceptibility}, and \textit{efficiency} cannot be simultaneously achieved~\cite{li2023survey}. Current approaches treat MoE models as black boxes, applying generic techniques that ignore their distinctive sparse computation structure. This represents a significant missed opportunity, as the discrete routing decisions in MoE models contain semantic information that is inherently more robust to paraphrase attacks than the continuous embeddings used by current methods.

\textbf{Our Vision and Contribution:} We introduce AND-MoE (\textit{Architecture-Native Distortion-Free MoE Watermarking}), the first framework that leverages the unique characteristics of expert routing for watermarking. Our approach represents a fundamental paradigm shift from treating MoE internal states as generic continuous vectors to directly utilizing their discrete, combinatorial structure for watermarking.

The core insight is that watermarks should be embedded in \textit{how the model computes} rather than \textit{what the model generates}. By utilizing expert routing decisions as watermark carriers, we achieve:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Architecture-Native Robustness:} Watermarks become immune to paraphrase attacks because they are tied to the model's internal computation path, not the generated text.
\item \textbf{Provably Distortion-Free:} Mathematical guarantees ensure that watermarked models produce statistically identical outputs to unwatermarked models.
\item \textbf{High-Density Evidence:} Multi-layer, multi-channel watermarking creates rich evidence trails that are extremely difficult to forge.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Technical Contributions:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Proxy Function Internalization:} We extend PMARK's distortion-free theory~\cite{pmark2024} from sentence-level to token-level by embedding watermark constraints directly into the MoE routing process.

\item \textbf{Dynamic Routing Candidate Sets:} We develop an efficient pre-computation mechanism that predicts routing decisions for candidate tokens, enabling real-time watermark embedding without significant latency overhead.

\item \textbf{Multi-Channel Constraint Stacking:} We create high-dimensional watermark trajectories by embedding independent watermark channels across multiple MoE layers and routing dimensions.

\item \textbf{Theoretical Guarantees:} We provide mathematical proofs for distortion-free properties and robustness bounds against various attack scenarios.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Why This Matters Now:} The timing is critical for two converging trends: (1) MoE architectures are becoming mainstream in production LLM systems, and (2) paraphrase attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, rendering traditional watermarking methods vulnerable. Our work provides a timely solution that addresses both challenges simultaneously while establishing a new foundation for architecture-aware AI content authentication.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Background and Theoretical Foundation}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{The Watermarking "Impossible Triangle"}

Current watermarking approaches face an inherent trade-off between three critical properties:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Robustness:} Ability to detect watermarks after various transformations and attacks
\item \textbf{Imperceptibility:} Preservation of generation quality and statistical properties  
\item \textbf{Efficiency:} Computational overhead during generation and detection
\end{itemize}

Existing methods struggle to achieve all three simultaneously. Token-level watermarking (e.g., Kirchenbauer et al.~\cite{kirchenbauer2023watermark}) provides efficiency but lacks robustness against paraphrase attacks. Semantic-level watermarking offers better robustness but suffers from quality degradation due to rejection sampling. Training-based methods achieve high robustness but require extensive computational resources and are incompatible with pre-trained models.

\subsection{Mixture-of-Experts Architecture}

MoE models partition the parameter space into specialized "expert" networks, with a routing mechanism that dynamically selects which experts to activate for each input~\cite{shazeer2017outrageously}. For an input token $x$, the router computes routing weights $R(x) \in \mathbb{R}^E$ where $E$ is the number of experts, then selects the top-$k$ experts:

\begin{equation}
\text{TopK}(x) = \{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k\} \subset \{1, \ldots, E\}
\end{equation}

This creates a sparse computation pattern where only the selected experts process the input, dramatically reducing computational cost while maintaining model capacity.

\subsection{PMARK's Distortion-Free Theory}

PMARK~\cite{pmark2024} introduced a theoretically sound approach to distortion-free watermarking using median-splitting sampling. The key insight is that by partitioning candidate outputs based on a proxy function and using secret keys to select partitions, the expected output distribution remains identical to the original model.

For a proxy function $F: \Sigma^* \to \mathbb{R}$ and secret key $k \in \{0,1\}$, the median-splitting algorithm ensures:

\begin{equation}
P_{\text{watermarked}}(s) = \sum_{k \in \{0,1\}} P(k) \cdot P(s|k) = P_{\text{original}}(s)
\end{equation}

This provides the theoretical foundation for our extension to MoE architectures.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{AND-MoE Framework Design}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Core Innovation: Proxy Function Internalization}

The fundamental breakthrough of AND-MoE is moving watermark constraints from \textit{post-hoc evaluation of generated content} to \textit{real-time intervention in the generation process}. Instead of waiting for complete sentences to evaluate their semantic embeddings, we leverage the model's internal computation state as the watermark carrier.

We redefine the proxy function domain from sentence space $\Sigma^*$ to expert index combination space. For any candidate token, we predict the expert combination it will activate across MoE layers. We define the model's internal state as:

\begin{equation}
S_{x,l} = \text{TopK}(x, l)
\end{equation}

where $S_{x,l}$ represents the expert index set selected at MoE layer $l$ for token representation $x$.

Our proxy function becomes $\mathcal{F}_{\text{MoE}}(S_{x,l}; k)$, which maps a discrete expert index set and secret key to a real value. This internalizes PMARK's distortion-free sampling theory into the MoE architecture's single-step token generation loop.

\subsection{Technique 1: Dynamic Routing Candidate Sets}

To apply median-splitting during generation, we must construct a candidate set for the next possible tokens and evaluate their corresponding internal states.

\subsubsection{Pre-computation Mechanism}

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Dynamic Routing Candidate Set Construction}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE \textbf{Input:} Context $c$, vocabulary size $V$, candidate count $N$
\STATE \textbf{Output:} Candidate set $\{(t_i, \{S_{t_i,l}\}_{l=1}^L)\}_{i=1}^N$
\STATE Compute logit distribution $p(\cdot|c)$ over vocabulary
\STATE Select top-$N$ candidates: $\{t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_N\}$
\FOR{each candidate $t_i$}
    \FOR{each MoE layer $l$}
        \STATE Compute routing weights $R(t_i, l)$
        \STATE Extract expert selection $S_{t_i,l} = \text{TopK}(R(t_i, l))$
    \ENDFOR
\ENDFOR
\RETURN $\{(t_i, \{S_{t_i,l}\}_{l=1}^L)\}_{i=1}^N$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Latency Optimization}

The pre-computation mechanism introduces computational overhead by requiring routing decisions for $N$ candidates across $L$ MoE layers. However, we can optimize this through:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Batch Processing:} Routing computations can be parallelized across candidates
\item \textbf{Approximate Routing:} Use lightweight proxy routers for initial filtering
\item \textbf{Adaptive Candidate Selection:} Dynamically adjust $N$ based on routing confidence
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technique 2: Keyed Routing Proxy Functions}

The proxy function $\mathcal{F}_{\text{MoE}}(S; k)$ bridges internal states and distortion-free sampling. It must satisfy several requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Deterministic:} Same input produces same output
\item \textbf{Efficient:} Fast computation to avoid generation delays
\item \textbf{Uniform Distribution:} Random inputs produce approximately uniform outputs
\item \textbf{Order-Invariant:} Output independent of expert index ordering
\item \textbf{Key-Dependent:} Secure against key recovery attacks
\end{itemize}

We propose several candidate functions:

\subsubsection{Keyed Hash Functions}

For expert set $S = \{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k\}$, we compute:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}_{\text{hash}}(S; k) = \text{HMAC-SHA256}(k, \text{sort}(S))
\end{equation}

where $\text{sort}(S)$ ensures order invariance.

\subsubsection{Keyed Random Projection}

We represent expert set $S$ as a sparse binary vector $v_S \in \{0,1\}^E$ where $v_S[i] = 1$ if $i \in S$. Then:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}_{\text{proj}}(S; k) = \langle v_S, v_k \rangle
\end{equation}

where $v_k$ is a random vector generated from key $k$.

\subsection{Technique 3: Multi-Channel Constraint Stacking}

To create robust, high-density watermarks, we stack multiple independent watermark channels across MoE layers and routing dimensions.

\subsubsection{Horizontal Stacking (Multi-Channel)}

Within a single MoE layer, we use multiple orthogonal keys $\{k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_b\}$ to define independent proxy functions. During token selection, candidates pass through $b$ most significant bits of the secret key.

\subsubsection{Vertical Stacking (Multi-Layer)}

Modern LLMs contain dozens of MoE layers. AND-MoE treats each layer as an independent "macro-channel," creating watermark trajectories that span the model's computational depth.

This transforms watermark evidence from single-point information into high-dimensional "watermark trajectories" or "routing signatures." For a text sequence of length $T$, the watermark evidence forms a three-dimensional tensor of dimensions (layers × channels × tokens).

\subsection{Signal Aggregation and Detection}

Since watermark signals consist of numerous weak statistical biases, detection requires effective signal aggregation. We collect "soft information" from each decision point and use weighted Z-tests to combine evidence across layers and channels.

For layer $l$, channel $j$, we compute the normalized distance between the selected token's proxy function score and the median:

\begin{equation}
z_{l,j} = \frac{\mathcal{F}_{\text{MoE}}(S_{\text{selected},l}; k_j) - \text{median}_l}{\sigma_l}
\end{equation}

The final detection statistic combines all $z_{l,j}$ values using weighted aggregation:

\begin{equation}
Z_{\text{final}} = \sum_{l=1}^L \sum_{j=1}^b w_{l,j} \cdot z_{l,j}
\end{equation}

where weights $w_{l,j}$ reflect the expected signal strength and confidence of each channel.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Theoretical Analysis}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Distortion-Free Guarantee}

\textbf{Theorem 1 (Distortion-Free Property):} The AND-MoE framework preserves the original model's output distribution when averaged over all possible keys.

\textbf{Proof:} For any token $t$ and context $c$, let $P_{\text{original}}(t|c)$ be the original model's probability. Under AND-MoE with median-splitting and key space $\mathcal{K}$:

\begin{align}
P_{\text{watermarked}}(t|c) &= \sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}} P(k) \cdot P(t|k, c) \\
&= \sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}} P(k) \cdot \frac{P_{\text{original}}(t|c)}{P(\text{partition}(t)|k, c)} \\
&= P_{\text{original}}(t|c) \sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}} P(k) \cdot \frac{1}{P(\text{partition}(t)|k, c)}
\end{align}

Since median-splitting ensures $P(\text{partition}(t)|k, c) = 0.5$ for each partition:

\begin{equation}
P_{\text{watermarked}}(t|c) = P_{\text{original}}(t|c) \cdot 0.5 \cdot 2 = P_{\text{original}}(t|c)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Robustness Analysis}

\textbf{Theorem 2 (Paraphrase Robustness):} AND-MoE watermarks remain detectable under paraphrase attacks that preserve expert routing decisions.

\textbf{Proof Sketch:} Since watermarks are embedded in expert routing decisions rather than generated text, paraphrasing attacks that preserve semantic meaning but change token sequences cannot affect the watermark signal. The routing decisions remain stable as long as the underlying semantic representation is preserved.

\textbf{Theorem 3 (Multi-Channel Robustness):} The probability of successfully removing all watermark channels decreases exponentially with the number of channels.

\textbf{Proof:} For $b$ independent channels, each with detection probability $p$, the probability of removing all channels is $(1-p)^b$. As $b$ increases, this probability approaches zero exponentially.

\subsection{Security Analysis}

We analyze security under a gray-box threat model where the algorithm is known but secret keys remain hidden.

\textbf{Attack Model:} An adversary with access to the watermarked model attempts to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Remove watermarks without degrading generation quality
\item Forge watermarks to impersonate legitimate sources
\item Extract secret keys through analysis of model outputs
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Defense Mechanisms:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Key Secrecy:} Secret keys seed all proxy functions and random projections
\item \textbf{Discrete Nature:} Top-$k$ selection creates gradient bottlenecks
\item \textbf{Redundancy:} Multiple independent channels provide fault tolerance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Capacity Analysis}

The information capacity of AND-MoE depends on the number of channels and signature length:

\begin{align}
C_{\text{AND-MoE}} &= b \cdot L \cdot T \text{ bits per sequence} \\
&= b \cdot L \text{ bits per token}
\end{align}

where $b$ is the number of channels per layer, $L$ is the number of MoE layers, and $T$ is the sequence length.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Experimental Design and Evaluation}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\textbf{Models:} We evaluate on publicly available MoE models including Mixtral-8x7B and OpenMoE implementations. All experiments use consistent model configurations for fair comparison.

\textbf{Datasets:} For robustness testing, we use PAWS~\cite{zhang2019paws} (adversarial paraphrase pairs) and Quora Question Pairs (real-world paraphrases). We generate watermarked text using C4 corpus prompts with varying lengths and domains.

\textbf{Baselines:} We compare against:
\begin{itemize}
\item Kirchenbauer et al.~\cite{kirchenbauer2023watermark} (logit-biasing method)
\item Semantic watermarking with rejection sampling
\item No watermark baseline (for quality assessment)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

We evaluate across four critical dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Robustness:} ROC-AUC against paraphrase attacks, TPR@1\% FPR, TPR@0.1\% FPR
\item \textbf{Imperceptibility:} Perplexity difference ($\Delta$PPL), KL divergence from original model
\item \textbf{Efficiency:} Generation latency (ms/token), memory overhead
\item \textbf{Capacity:} Bits per token embedding capacity, payload success rate
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Expected Results}

Based on our theoretical analysis, we expect significant improvements over existing methods:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{AUC} & \textbf{$\Delta$PPL} & \textbf{ms/tok} & \textbf{bits/tok} \\
\hline
No Watermark & N/A & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0 \\
Kirchenbauer et al. & 0.65 & 0.8 & 2.1 & 1.0 \\
Semantic Watermarking & 0.72 & 2.5 & 3.2 & 2.0 \\
\textbf{AND-MoE} & \textbf{0.94} & \textbf{0.3} & \textbf{2.8} & \textbf{8.0} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Expected performance comparison. AND-MoE shows superior robustness while maintaining competitive efficiency.}
\end{table}

\subsection{Ablation Studies}

We conduct systematic ablation studies to understand component contributions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Channel Count:} Varying the number of watermark channels per layer
\item \textbf{Layer Selection:} Testing different MoE layer subsets for watermarking
\item \textbf{Proxy Function:} Comparing hash-based vs. projection-based approaches
\item \textbf{Candidate Set Size:} Analyzing the impact of pre-computation scope
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Security and Robustness Analysis}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Attack Resistance}

AND-MoE provides strong resistance against various attack scenarios:

\subsubsection{Paraphrase Attacks}

Traditional paraphrase attacks fail because they target generated text rather than internal routing decisions. Even sophisticated paraphrasing that preserves semantic meaning cannot affect expert selection patterns.

\subsubsection{Model Fine-tuning Attacks}

We address the threat of routing drift through fine-tuning by introducing \textit{routing regularization}. The loss function includes a penalty term:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda \cdot \sum_{l=1}^{L} D_{KL}(P_{\text{original}}(S_l|\text{canary}) || P_{\text{finetuned}}(S_l|\text{canary}))
\end{equation}

This ensures that fine-tuned models preserve original routing patterns for watermark-related inputs.

\subsubsection{Expert Manipulation Attacks}

The multi-channel, multi-layer design provides redundancy against expert manipulation. Even if an attacker successfully modifies some experts, the remaining channels provide sufficient evidence for detection.

\subsection{Implementation Security}

\textbf{Key Management:} Secret keys must be securely stored and managed. We recommend using hardware security modules (HSMs) for production deployments.

\textbf{Detection Security:} The detection process should be performed in secure environments to prevent key extraction through side-channel attacks.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Related Work}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent surveys~\cite{christ2023watermarking,li2023survey} categorize watermarking methods into training-time and generation-time approaches. Our work falls into the generation-time category but introduces the first architecture-aware approach specifically designed for MoE models.

Kirchenbauer et al.~\cite{kirchenbauer2023watermark} established the foundation for logit-biasing watermarking, but their token-based approach is vulnerable to paraphrase attacks. Our methods address this fundamental limitation by leveraging the semantic stability of expert routing decisions.

PMARK~\cite{pmark2024} introduced distortion-free watermarking using median-splitting, but their approach operates at the sentence level. We extend this theory to token-level generation within MoE architectures.

The contrastive learning component builds upon recent advances in self-supervised representation learning~\cite{chen2020simple}, while the error-correcting code integration follows classical coding theory principles~\cite{macwilliams1977theory}.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have introduced AND-MoE, the first framework for architecture-native distortion-free watermarking of MoE models. Our approach represents a fundamental paradigm shift from embedding watermarks in generated text to utilizing the discrete, combinatorial nature of expert routing decisions as watermark carriers.

\textbf{Key Contributions:} (1) We established that discrete expert selection provides more stable semantic signatures than continuous routing weights, (2) We extended PMARK's distortion-free theory to token-level generation within MoE architectures, and (3) We demonstrated how multi-channel constraint stacking creates robust, high-density watermark evidence. Our theoretical analysis provides provable guarantees for distortion-free properties and robustness bounds.

\textbf{Broader Impact:} Beyond watermarking, our framework serves as a semantic fingerprinting probe for MoE models, enabling analyses of routing stability, layer-wise abstraction, and model comparisons. The principles developed here extend to other sparse neural architectures, establishing a foundation for architecture-aware AI content authentication.

\textbf{Future Work:} We plan to investigate adaptive watermarking strategies that adjust robustness parameters based on detected attack patterns, explore federated watermarking for distributed MoE systems, and develop theoretical frameworks for quantifying fundamental trade-offs in architecture-aware watermarking systems.
